# BYTEWORKS

## About

ByteWorks is a terminal factory game. It's inspired by the amazing game Satisfactory and Factorio, but is more of a fun project than a enjoyable game. It's written entirely in Rust with using [Ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui) for pretty terminal graphics. It's in very early access and does not have many features, so it's not any fun at the moment :)

## What's currently in the game

Currently there aren't many features present, only very basic stuff.

In the game there is:
 - Pretty UI (although very minimal at the moment)
 - Cursor movement
 - Placement of machines (no customizability yet)
 - Some keyboard shortcuts

## Roadmap

 [ ] Add in support for more machines
 [ ] Add fixed resource nodes
 [ ] Add production, i.e. mining from nodes, smelting, etc.
 [ ] Build a better UI system for scalability
